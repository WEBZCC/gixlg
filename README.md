##GIXLG - GIX looking glass

GIXLG is a looking glass implementation which uses [ExaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp).
Unlike many other looking glasses which usually use a shell access to routers or BGP processes GIXLG pushes all updates to a MySQL database. This allows for further analysis BGP data by 3rd party software.
